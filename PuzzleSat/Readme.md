PuzzleSat is a 3d printable modular CubeSat shell and internal structure system. With this system, one can build CubeSat of varying forms and configurations, including 1U CubeSats, 3U × 3U × 3U CubeSats, and miscellaneous formations like rings, spheres, and cacti (a U refers to a standard CubeSat unit which is a decimeter cube (Walker, 2017)).  As of the 7th iteration of the design, the system consists of 13 parts that interlock together to form a shell.  All parts are based off plates that interlock to form the structural support for the PC/104 Printed Circuit Board (PCB) standard. This system is meant for engineering modeling of CubeSats, as to give developers an idea of how the final product would be wired and effectively look.

Common

The common parts are the parts that one would be printed out for every CubeSat size.

Skeletal Female

The skeletal female part is one of the main structural components of PuzzleSat.  It holds the slots for a slide part as well as the openings for the snap fits of the male parts.  The term skeletal refers to there being a bracing structure in between the outer rim of this panel.  This part's secondary purpose is to act as a wall to the outside of the CubeSat.

Skeletal Male

The skeletal male part is one of the main structural components of PuzzleSat.  It holds the slots for a slide part as well as houses the snap fits that integrate with the openings of the female parts.  The term skeletal refers to there being a bracing structure in between the outer rim of this panel.  This part's secondary purpose is to act as a wall to the outside of the CubeSat.

Skeletal Slide

The skeletal slide part is a thin slide that integrates with both male and female parts.  This part allows for the PC/104 board to fit inside of the CubeSat without interfering with the other structural components.  The term skeletal refers to there being a bracing structure in between the outer edge of this panel.  This part's secondary purpose is to act as a wall to the outside of the CubeSat.
